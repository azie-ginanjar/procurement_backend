        Collaboration
        =============
        
        We're embracing simple workflow as following:
        
        * ``master`` branch keeps production-ready deploy-able code.
        * ``develop`` branch keeps in-progress code, e.g. features. Also, we use topic branch for feature.
        * If ``master`` is buggy, checkout from it into a topic branch.
          Merge to ``master`` (and likely ``develop`` as well) after it has been done.
        * If in doubt, always use topic branch and ask for design and/or implementation review from peers.
